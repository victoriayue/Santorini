# Santorini

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `santorini` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:santorini, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/santorini](https://hexdocs.pm/santorini).



## How to start 

By default, the santorini.exe will be the first move. When it shows "Your turn: ", press Enter button and it will start with location [1,2], [2,3]. 



### TODO

- build .exe has some error.
